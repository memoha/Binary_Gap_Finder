Binary Gap Finder
This Python script calculates the length of the longest binary gap in a given positive integer. A binary gap is the maximum sequence of consecutive zeros in the binary representation of the number.


How to Use
1.Clone the repository to your local machine
  git clone https://github.com/memoha/binary-gap-finder.git
2.Navigate to the project directory
  cd binary-gap-finder
3.Run the script by providing a positive integer as input
  python binary_gap_finder.py
Example:
 Enter a number: 44
4.The script will display the binary gap for the given number


Sample Output
For the input 44:
 Binary Representation: 101010
 Binary Gap: 1

 How It Works
1.The script takes a positive integer as input.
2.Converts the integer to its binary representation.
3.Iterates through the binary string, counting consecutive zeros to find the binary gap.
4.Displays the length of the longest binary gap.

HAPPY CODING!
